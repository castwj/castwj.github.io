# Projects

## 1. PorcineAI-enhancer: Prediction of Pig Enhancer Sequences Using Convolutional Neural Networks

Supervisor: Prof. [Liangke Wu](http://cast1.cau.edu.cn/art/2022/3/8/art_44918_1.html)

June 2022 --- May. 2023, China Agricultural University

In this research, I propose a method of integrating CNN architecture to predict pig enhancer sequences, achieving satisfactory performance. The prediction accuracy is around 90% for general enhancer sequences and over 70% for tissue-specific enhancers.

## 2. Comparison for association analysis and fine mapping software

Supervisor: Prof. [Lingzhao Fang](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/lingzhao-fang(4e548f18-1d3b-4395-b7ad-6c7b7d1d1f79).html)

September 2022 --- Now, Aarhus University

In this study, I first simulated genotype and phenotype data, then divided association analysis software and fine mapping software based on statistical principles, and studied their performance differences.
